Syncing garmin activities with this app and push only select activities to strava 

## Issue
Garmin activities sync directly to strava and it hinders user abilities edit activities before pushing to strava

This app solves it by providing a intermediary which will show all garmin activities from a device. From this app the activities can be posted to strava
